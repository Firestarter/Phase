A dead simple and highly efficient open-source warps plugin! Phase is completely async and uses PaperLib for async teleportation. The plugin uses a GUI system for warp browsing and management, which makes it one of the most dead simple to use warps plugins out there!

Phase is completely open source, so feel free to use it and modify it as you wish. Phase depends on [Kerosene](https://github.com/FirestarterMC/Kerosene). ✨
